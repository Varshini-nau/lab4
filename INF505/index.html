        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>In converting my resume to HTML, I made several structural choices to ensure the content was clearly organized and easy to read. Here are the key decisions and reasons behind them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Header Tag:</strong> I used the &lt;header&gt; tag to encapsulate the main contact information. This provides a clear introduction to the document.</li>
            <li><strong>Section Tags:</strong> Each major part of the resume (Objective, Education, Experience, Skills) is wrapped in a &lt;section&gt; tag. This helps in logically grouping related content together.</li>
            <li><strong>Unordered Lists:</strong> I used &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;li&gt; tags to list education details and job responsibilities. This presents the information in a structured and easy-to-follow format.</li>
            <li><strong>Header Tags within Sections:</strong> Each job title and education level is wrapped in &lt;h3&gt; tags to indicate subheadings, providing a hierarchical structure to the content.</li>
            <li><strong>Footer Script:</strong> The provided script at the end of the document ensures that the last modified date is dynamically displayed, meeting the assignment requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Stylistic Choices</h2>
        <p>Here are the key decisions and reasons behind the stylistic choices made in the CSS:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Font choices:</strong> I chose 'Arial, sans-serif' for its readability and modern look. Sans-serif fonts are generally easier to read on screens compared to serif fonts.</li>
            <li><strong>Heading sizes and main text size:</strong> The main title is set to 2.5em to make it stand out as the most important element on the page. The body text is 1.2em to ensure it is easily readable without straining the eyes.</li>
            <li><strong>Color choices:</strong> The background color is a light gray (#f4f4f9) which reduces eye strain and creates a calming effect. The text color is dark gray (#333) which provides a good contrast against the light background, improving readability.</li>
            <li><strong>Margin and padding choices:</strong> A 20px margin around the body creates whitespace that helps with readability and prevents the text from being too close to the edges of the browser window. The line height is set to 1.6 to provide enough space between lines, making the text easier to read.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>HTML Abuse</h2>
        <p>In converting the plain HTML to styled HTML, I corrected the title tag from an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> to an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to follow proper semantic structure. The title of the essay should be the highest-level heading on the page, and using <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> reflects its importance correctly.</p>

    <footer>
        <p>Last updated: 
            <span id="lastModified"></span>
        </p>
    </footer>
    <script type="text/javascript">
         var x = document.lastModified;
         document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
    </script>
</body>
</html>
